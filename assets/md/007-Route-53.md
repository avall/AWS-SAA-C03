## Hosted zone
- A hosted zone is similar to a traditional DNS zone file. It represents a container to collect DNS records 
  that can be managed together ,belonging to a single parent domain name. All the DNS record sets 
  within a hosted zone share the same parent domain name. It means that all the DNS records within a 
  hosted zone share the same parent domain name. It means that all the DNS records within a
  hosted zone must have the hosted zone's domain name as a suffix.
