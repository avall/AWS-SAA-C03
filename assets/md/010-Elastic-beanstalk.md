## Introduction
Developer problems on AWS:
- Managing infrastructure
- Deploying Code
- Configuring all the databases, load balancers, etc
- Scaling concerns
- Most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
- All the developers want is for their code to run!
- Possibly, consistently across different applications and environments
