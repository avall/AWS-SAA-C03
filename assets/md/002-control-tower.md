# Control Tower

## Designing a Security Strategy for Multiple AWS Accounts
- AWS Control Tower: Helps set up and govern a secure multi-account AWS
environment. It automates the setup of AWS accounts, and it enforces 
governance using AWS Organizations.
- Service Control Policies (SCPs): Allow organizations to set fine-grained
  permissions for their AWS accounts. SCPs are used to control access to
  AWS services across accounts, helping to ensure compliance.
