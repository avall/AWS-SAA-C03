- **Rent Virtual Machines:** EC2 allows users to rent
  virtual machines, known as instances, tailored to specific requirements
  such as compute power, memory, and storage.
- **Storing Data:** storage options include Elastic Block Store (EBS) for
  virtual drives and Elastic File System (EFS) for network-attached
  storage. EC2 instances can also leverage Instance Store, offering
  ephemeral storage directly attached to the host machine.

- **Distributing WorkLoad:** Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) facilitates the
  distribution of incoming application traffic across multiple EC2
  instances.
- **Scaling Services:** Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) enable automatic scaling of
  EC2 instances based on predefined criteria. This ensures that
  applications can dynamically adapt to varying workloads, optimizing
  performance and cost efficiency.
