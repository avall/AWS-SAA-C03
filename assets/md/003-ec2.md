# (EC2) Elastic Compute Cloud
![](../uml/003-ec2/ec2-intro.svg)

- **Rent Virtual Machines:** EC2 allows users to rent
  virtual machines, known as instances, tailored to specific requirements
  such as compute power, memory, and storage.
- **Storing Data:** storage options include Elastic Block Store (EBS) for
  virtual drives and Elastic File System (EFS) for network-attached
  storage. EC2 instances can also leverage Instance Store, offering
  ephemeral storage directly attached to the host machine.

- **Distributing WorkLoad:** Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) facilitates the
  distribution of incoming application traffic across multiple EC2
  instances.
- **Scaling Services:** Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) enable automatic scaling of
  EC2 instances based on predefined criteria. This ensures that
  applications can dynamically adapt to varying workloads, optimizing
  performance and cost efficiency.

## EC2 Sizing & configuration options
- **Operating System (OS):** Linux, Windows or MacOs
- **Compute Power & Cores (CPU):** level of compute
  power and the number of cores to meet application requirements.
- **Random-Access Memory (RAM):** Specify the amount of memory needed
  for optimal performance.
- **Storage Space:** Determine the storage type, including network-attached
  (EBS & EFS) and hardware (EC2 Instance Store) options.
- **Network Configuration:** Configure network-related settings, such as the
  speed of the network card, assignment of public IP addresses. 
- **Firewall rules** through security groups.
- **Bootstrap Script (EC2 User Data):** Use EC2 User Data to automate boot tasks as: 
  - Run scripts at the instanceâ€™s first start. This script, executed
    with ***root*** user privileges, can perform actions such as:
    - installing updates,
    - installing software
    - downloading files from the internet.
  - Anything you can think of

## EC2 InstanceTypes - Overview
When we see `m5.2xlarge`\
- ***m***: instance type
- ***5***: Generation (indicating AWS improvements over time)
- ***2xlarge***: Size within the instance class
