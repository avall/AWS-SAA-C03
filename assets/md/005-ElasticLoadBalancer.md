# Pre-knowledge
## Health check
- Health check are used to monitor the status of targets in a load balancer’s target group. 
Requests for online availability status are sent to registered targets at a configured interval 
to verify that registered targets are available to serve traffic. If a target fails a health check, 
it is removed from the target group and will not receive traffic until it is deemed healthy again.
- They enable the load balancer to know if instances (it forwards traffic to) are available to reply any requests:
  - The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common). 
  - If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy.

## Sticky sessions
- Use case: make sure the user doesn’t lose his session data.
- Sticky sessions are used to ensure that a user's session is always directed to the same backend server.
  Allow a load balancer to direct a user’s requests consistently to the same backend instance, based on
  some identifier.
- Enabling sticky sessions may introduce imbalance in the load distribution
  across backend EC2 instances: since the same user is always directed to the
  same instance, some instances might receive more traffic than others,
  potentially leading to uneven utilization of resources.
- Sticky Session works for Classic Load Balancer (CLB), Application Load Balancer (ALB) & 
  Network Load Balancer (NLB).
- For both **CLB** & **ALB**, the “cookie” used for stickiness has an expiration date that we control

### Cookie Names

- _Application-based Cookies_
  - Custom cookie
    - Generated by the target
    - Can include any custom attributes required by the application
    - Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
    - Don’t use **_AWSALB_**, **_AWSALBAPP_**, or **_AWSALBTG_** (reserved for use by the ELB)
  - _Application cookie_
    - Cookie generated by the load balancer based on information from the application. 
      It allows the load balancer to direct requests from clients back to the correct target (sticky session).
    - Generated by the load balancer 
    - Cookie name is **_AWSALBAPP_**
- _Duration-based Cookies_
  - These cookies are used for maintaining **_session stickiness_** over a **specified duration**.
  - Cookie generated by the load balancer
  - Cookie name is:
    - **_AWSALB_** for ALB
    - **_AWSELB_** for CLB

## Target group
- Target group is a set (group) of one or more registered destinations (services) that receive traffic.

# Load Balancer
## General knowledge
- Load balancers optimize:
  - the performance
  - the availability
  - the security 

  of your applications by:
  - distributing traffic.
  - managing failures.
  - providing centralized access points.

- **_General Features_**:
  - **Spread load across multiple downstream instances**: distribute incoming
    traffic across multiple servers or EC2 instances. This ensures that no
    single server is overwhelmed and improves the overall performance and
    responsiveness of your application.
  - **Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application**: load balancers
    provide a single DNS entry point for your application. This simplifies the
    access for users and clients, abstracting the complexity of managing
    multiple server addresses.
  - **Do regular health checks to your instances**: perform regular health
    checks to determine the status of each downstream instance. If an
    instance is found to be unhealthy, the load balancer can take it out of
    rotation, preventing it from receiving traffic until it is healthy again.
  - **Provide SSL Termination (HTTPS) for your websites**: load balancers can
    handle SSL termination, offloading the task of decrypting HTTPS traffic
    from the downstream instances. This helps in reducing the
    computational load on the instances, improving overall performance.
  - **Enforce stickiness with cookies**: can enforce session stickiness by
    associating a user with a specific server based on a cookie or other
    session-related information. This ensures that subsequent requests from
    the same user are directed to the same backend server, maintaining
    session state.
  - **High Availability across zones**: load balancers can be configured to
    operate across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). This enhances the high
    availability of your application by distributing traffic across
    geographically separated data centers.
  - **Separate public traffic from private traffic**: load balancers can be used to
    separate public-facing traffic from private or internal traffic. This helps
    in securing and managing different types of communication within your
    architecture.

# Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
## Introduction (ELB)
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a **fully managed load balancing service** provided by AWS.
It distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances),
in multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
- Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (Amazon ELB) is a load balancing service that distributes incoming 
application traffic across Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon ECS containers, AWS Lambda functions & IP addresses.
- ELB helps to ensure that your application is highly available and scalable by distributing incoming
traffic across multiple resources.
- _**ELB key features**_:
  - **High Availability**: ELB is designed for high availability by distributing
    traffic across multiple Availability Zones. If one zone becomes
    unavailable, traffic is automatically routed to healthy instances in other
    zones.
  - **Automatic scaling**: ELB integrates with Auto Scaling Groups, allowing
    you to automatically scale the number of instances based on demand. It
    dynamically adjusts the number of instances behind the load balancer to
    handle changes in traffic.
    <br/><br/>
  ![Auto Scaling groups](../uml/003-ec2/ec2-good-metrics-to-scale.svg)

    <br/>
  - **Health checks**: ELB regularly performs health checks on registered
    instances and routes traffic only to healthy instances. If an instance is
    unhealthy, ELB will automatically stop sending traffic to that instance
    until it passes the health check again.
    <br/><br/>
![VPC Overview](../images/health-check.svg)
    <br/><br/>
  - **ELB supports SSL termination**, allowing it to handle HTTPS traffic. It
    also integrates with AWS Certificate Manager for easy management of
    SSL/TLS certificates. Network Load Balancer additionally provides source
    IP preservation, enabling applications that rely on the IP address of the
    client.
  - **ELB integrates with AWS CloudWatch**, providing metrics and logs to
    monitor the performance and health of the load balancer. This includes
    information on request rates, latency, and error rates.

## **Listener**
- It is a process that checks (listen) for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure.
- Each listener has a rule based on which an action is taken based on a request.

| **Listener (protocol & port)** | **Rule**                           | **Action**                                         |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| http / 80                      | Check if `User-Agent` is Mozilla   | Forward To.                                        |
| http / 80                      | Check if `Host` Header is demo.com | Redirect to.                                       |
| http / 80                      | Check if path is `/videos`         | Fixed response. `200` & `Content-Type: Text/plain` |

## Cross Zone Load Balancing
- it may increase data transfer costs between
  instances in different AZs (Network Load Balancer - NLB).
- Enabled by default in Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Disabled by default in Network Load Balancer (NLB)

| **ELB** | **Cross Zone enabled by default**           | **Charges inter AZ data** |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| ALB     | Yes (can be disabled at Target Group level) | No                        |
| CLB     | No                                          | No                        |
| NLB     | No                                          | Yes                       |

## Connection Draining
- It is a feature provided by AWS ELBs that ensures in-flight requests are
  completed before instances are taken out of service.
- When an instance is marked as unhealthy or is being removed from an Auto Scaling group,
  Connection Draining helps to handle the existing connections to that instance gracefully.
- Connection Draining works in coordination with health checks: if an instance fails a health check
  or is otherwise marked as unhealthy. Connection Draining allows existing connections
  to be completed before the instance is fully removed from the load balancer.
- Time to complete “in-flight requests” (active) while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy.
  You can configure a timeout period for Connection Draining, specifying the maximum time the load balancer should allow in-flight requests to continue
  on an instance marked for removal. The time must be Between 1 & 3600 seconds (default: 300 seconds).
  - Can be disabled (set value to 0)
  - Set to a low value if your requests are short
- During this period new requests are not sent to the instance marked as unhealthy.
  The load balancer stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is de-registering.
- It is particularly useful in scenarios such as rolling deployments, where instances are
  replaced with new versions. It is also valuable in conjunction with Auto
  Scaling groups, as instances can be added or removed dynamically based on
  the demand.

## Types of Load Balancer
### Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- it operates at the **_application_** layer that it is the 7th layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model.

![OSI Layers](../images/osi.svg)


- it provides fixed hostname **_XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com_**
- When ordering an Application Load Balancer, we must choose:
  - **_IF_** the load balancer 
    accepts **_public inbound traffic (Internet-facing)_** or **_private inbound traffic (internal)_**
  - The **_Availability Zones / Subnets_** where the ALB will operate. Remember that we assign Av.Zones to EC2 instances 
    when we set the **_Subnet_** in the EC2 definition. Remember that each **_subnet_** is defined in a **_single availability zone_**, 
- **Health checks** are at the **target group level**
- Cross-zone load balancing is enabled by default. No charges for inter AZ data traffic.
- The target service don't see the IP of the requester.
  - The true IP of the client is inserted in the header **_X-Forwarded-For_**
  - We can also get Port (**_X-Forwarded-Port_**) and the protocol (_**X-Forwarded-Proto**_)
- ALB supports:
  - Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups).
  - routing to multiple applications on the same machine, making it well-
    suited for containerized applications where multiple services run on a
    single host.
  - Flexible routing based on various factors, including:
    - path in the URL.
    - hostname in the URL.
    - query string parameters.
    - headers ( **_host-header_**, **_HTTP-header_** ).
    
    This enables you to route traffic to different target groups based on specific conditions.
  - Redirects, which can be useful for scenarios like redirecting HTTP traffic
    to HTTPS for improved security.
  - Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS. Integrates 
    seamlessly with Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service), offering a port mapping 
    feature that allows dynamic port redirection within ECS.

#### **Application Load Balancer Security Group**
  - Allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic coming from anywhere.
#### **Service Security Group**
  - Allow traffic only from the application load balancer.

![VPC Overview](../images/alb-2.svg)

![VPC Overview](../images/alb.svg)

#### **Architecture tip**
- To give external & internal users access to a private application (located in private subnet).
  - If we stop the public side, the internal side is not affected.
  - We don't mix Public & Private traffic. Better for security reasons.
  - Save money because internal accesses are not spending money regarding internet traffic.

![VPC Overview](../images/alb-architecture-tip.svg)

### Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- Network Load Balancer operates on the 4th layer of the OSI model.
- Cross-zone load balancing is disabled by default. We pay charges for inter AZ data traffic (if enabled).
