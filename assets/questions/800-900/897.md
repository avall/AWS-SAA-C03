A company runs a critical data analysis job each week before the first day of the work week. The job requires at least 1 hour to complete the analysis. The job is stateful and cannot tolerate interruptions. The company needs a solution to run the job on AWS.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create a container for the job. Schedule the job to run as an AWS Fargate task on an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster by using Amazon EventBridge Scheduler.

B. Configure the job to run in an AWS Lambda function. Create a scheduled rule in Amazon EventBridge to invoke the Lambda function.

C. Configure an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 Spot Instances that run Amazon Linux. Configure a crontab entry on the instances to run the analysis.

D. Configure an AWS DataSync task to run the job. Configure a cron expression to run the task on a schedule.
