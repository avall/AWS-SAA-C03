A solutions architect is designing a three-tier web application. The architecture consists of an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) and a web tier that is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The application tier with the business logic runs on EC2 instances in private subnets. The database tier consists of Microsoft SQL Server that runs on EC2 instances in private subnets. Security is a high priority for the company.

A. Configure the security group for the web tier to allow inbound HTTPS traffic from the security group for the ALB.

B. Configure the security group for the web tier to allow outbound HTTPS traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.

C. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound Microsoft SQL Server traffic from the security group for the application tier.

D. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow outbound HTTPS traffic and Microsoft SQL Server traffic to the security group for the web tier.

E. Configure the security group for the application tier to allow inbound HTTPS traffic from the security group for the web tier.
