A company needs to optimize its Amazon S3 storage costs for an application that generates many files that cannot be recreated. Each file is approximately 5 MB and is stored in Amazon S3 Standard storage.

The company must store the files for 4 years before the files can be deleted. The files must be immediately accessible. The files are frequently accessed in the first 30 days of object creation, but they are rarely accessed after the first 30 days.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval 30 days after object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
B. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the files to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 30 days after object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
C. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the files to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days after object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
D. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the files to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days after object creation. Move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval 4 years after object creation.
