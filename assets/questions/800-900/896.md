A company is designing its production application's disaster recovery (DR) strategy. The application is backed by a MySQL database on an Amazon Aurora cluster in the us-east-1 Region. The company has chosen the us-west-1 Region as its DR Region.

The company's target recovery point objective (RPO) is 5 minutes and the target recovery time objective (RTO) is 20 minutes. The company wants to minimize configuration changes.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?

A. Create an Aurora read replica in us-west-1 similar in size to the production application's Aurora MySQL cluster writer instance.
B. Convert the Aurora cluster to an Aurora global database. Configure managed failover.
C. Create a new Aurora cluster in us-west-1 that has Cross-Region Replication.
D. Create a new Aurora cluster in us-west-1. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to sync both clusters.
