A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 

A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route trafic to the CloudFront distribution. 

B. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint Configure Route 53 to route trafic to the CloudFront distribution. 

C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the ALB and the CloudFront distribution as endpoints. Create a custom domain name that points to the accelerator DNS name. Use the custom domain name as an endpoint for the web application. 

D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint. Create two domain names. Point one domain name to the CloudFront DNS name for dynamic content. Point the other domain name to the accelerator DNS name for static content. Use the domain names as endpoints for the web application.

<b>A</b>

**A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.**

### Explanation:

1. **Amazon CloudFront:**
    - **Improved Performance and Reduced Latency:** CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations globally, reducing latency by delivering content from servers closest to the user. By setting up CloudFront with both the S3 bucket (for static content) and the ALB (for dynamic content) as origins, the company can ensure that both types of data are served with lower latency.
    - **Caching of Static and Dynamic Content:** CloudFront can cache both static and dynamic content. For dynamic data, you can configure CloudFront to forward requests to the origin (ALB) while caching static data directly from the S3 bucket.

2. **Route 53 Integration:**
    - **Custom Domain Name:** You can configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution. Since the company uses its own domain name registered with Route 53, you can easily point your domain to the CloudFront distribution, allowing for seamless integration and improved performance for users globally.

### Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:

- **B. CloudFront with ALB as an Origin and AWS Global Accelerator with S3:**
    - **Complexity and Redundancy:** Global Accelerator Standard accelerator doesn;t support s3 endpoints. While AWS Global Accelerator can reduce latency by directing traffic to the optimal endpoint, combining it with CloudFront for this use case introduces unnecessary complexity. CloudFront alone is sufficient to deliver both static and dynamic content efficiently, making Global Accelerator redundant here.

- **C. CloudFront with S3 as an Origin and AWS Global Accelerator with ALB:**
    - **Unnecessary Combination:** Global Accelerator Standard accelerator doesn't support CloudFront distribution as endpoint. This option splits responsibilities between CloudFront and Global Accelerator in a way that adds complexity without significant benefits. CloudFront is already designed to handle both types of content effectively, and adding Global Accelerator complicates the architecture unnecessarily.

- **D. Separate Domain Names for CloudFront and Global Accelerator:**
    - **Increased Management Complexity:** Global Accelerator Standard accelerator doesn't support s3 endpoints. Managing separate domain names for static and dynamic content increases complexity and doesn’t provide substantial benefits over using a single CloudFront distribution for both types of content. CloudFront alone can effectively serve both static and dynamic content with improved performance and lower latency.

In summary, **Option A** provides the most straightforward and effective solution for improving performance and reducing latency for both static and dynamic content, by leveraging CloudFront’s global edge network and integrating seamlessly with Amazon Route 53.
