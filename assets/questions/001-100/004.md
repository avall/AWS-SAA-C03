An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet. Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3? 

A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket. 
Explain: Gateway VPC endpoint can connect to S3 bucket privately without additional cost

B. Stream the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the logs to the S3 bucket. 
Explain: You can set up interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs for private network from EC2 to CloudWatch. But from CloudWatch to S3 bucket: Log data can take up to 12 hours to become available for export and the requirement only need EC2 to S3

C. Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access. 
Explain: Create an instance profile just grant access but not help EC2 connect to S3 privately

D. Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint
Explain: API Gateway like the proxy which receive network from out site and it forward request to AWS Lambda, Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing products such as Application Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis, or any publicly available HTTPS-based endpoint. But not S3
