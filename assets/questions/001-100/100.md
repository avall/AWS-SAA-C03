A company's containerized application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The application needs to download security certificates before it can communicate with other business applications. The company wants a highly secure solution to encrypt and decrypt the certificates in near real time. The solution also needs to store data in highly available storage after the data is encrypted. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 

A. Create AWS Secrets Manager secrets for encrypted certificates. Manually update the certificates as needed. Control access to the data by using fine-grained IAM access. 

B. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the Python cryptography library to receive and perform encryption operations. Store the function in an Amazon S3 bucket. 

(C). Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon S3. 

D. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes.

Explanation:
AWS KMS (Key Management Service) is a highly secure service designed for managing cryptographic keys and controlling their usage across AWS services and in your applications. By using AWS KMS, you can create, control, and manage the keys used to encrypt data, which aligns with the requirement for a highly secure solution to encrypt and decrypt certificates in near real time.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides highly available and durable storage for data. It's suitable for storing objects, including encrypted data such as security certificates. Amazon S3 offers built-in integration with AWS KMS for server-side encryption, which ensures that data is encrypted before it is stored and automatically decrypted when it is accessed by authorized users.

Option A is less suitable because AWS Secrets Manager is primarily designed for storing secrets like database passwords, API keys, and other configuration data rather than large volumes of encrypted data like security certificates. Additionally, manually updating certificates increases operational overhead.

Option B involves using an AWS Lambda function and the Python cryptography library to handle encryption operations. While this could be a feasible solution, it requires more custom development and maintenance effort compared to using AWS KMS, which is specifically designed for key management and encryption operations. This would result in higher operational overhead.

Option D suggests using Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store), which is typically used for storage attached to EC2 instances. While EBS can be encrypted using AWS KMS, it's not the most suitable storage option for storing certificates compared to Amazon S3. Additionally, using EBS volumes implies maintaining the underlying EC2 instance and attached storage, which increases operational overhead.
