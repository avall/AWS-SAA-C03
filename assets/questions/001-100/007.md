A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages. The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability. Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Configure the consumer applications to read and process the messages. 

B. Deploy the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics. 

C. Write the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with a single shard. Use an AWS Lambda function to preprocess messages and store them in Amazon DynamoDB. Configure the consumer applications to read from DynamoDB to process the messages. 

D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions. Confi gure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

Amazon SNS: Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables message publishing and subscription to topics. It provides fast and flexible communication between publishers and subscribers.
Amazon SQS: Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that decouples the components of a distributed application. It offers reliable and scalable queues for storing messages and enables applications to process them asynchronously. By publishing the messages to an Amazon SNS topic and using Amazon SQS subscriptions, the solution achieves decoupling and scalability. Multiple applications and microservices can subscribe to the topic and receive messages through their individual SQS queues. This allows for parallel processing and enables the system to handle varying message volumes, including spikes of up to 100,000 messages per second.

By default, an SQS queue can handle a maximum of 3,000 messages per second. However, you can request higher throughput by contacting AWS Support. AWS can increase the message throughput for your queue beyond the default limits in increments of 300 messages per second, up to a maximum of 10,000 messages per second.
