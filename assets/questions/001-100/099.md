A company is implementing a shared storage solution for a gaming application that is hosted in an on-premises data center. The company needs the ability to use Lustre clients to access data. The solution must be fully managed. Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Create an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Create a file share that uses the required client protocol. Connect the application server to the file share. 

B. Create an Amazon EC2 Windows instance. Install and configure a Windows file share role on the instance. Connect the application server to the file share. 

C. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system, and configure it to support Lustre. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system.

D. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system.

The correct answer is:\
\
**D. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system.**

### Explanation:

- **Amazon FSx for Lustre** is a fully managed file system service that is optimized for high-performance workloads such as machine learning, high-performance computing (HPC), video processing, and financial modeling. It specifically supports the Lustre file system, which is known for its low-latency, high-throughput capabilities. Lustre clients can connect directly to an FSx for Lustre file system, making it the ideal solution for workloads that require Lustre compatibility.

- **Option A** (AWS Storage Gateway file gateway) provides a way to access Amazon S3 data in a file interface. It is not designed to support Lustre clients or provide the performance characteristics associated with Lustre.

- **Option B** suggests setting up a Windows file share on an Amazon EC2 instance. This option does not provide a fully managed solution and does not support the Lustre file system, which is a key requirement.

- **Option C** mentions creating an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). While EFS is a fully managed file system that provides scalable storage for use with Amazon EC2, it does not support the Lustre file system, which is required for this solution.

Therefore, **Option D** (Amazon FSx for Lustre) is the correct choice as it meets the requirements of being fully managed, compatible with Lustre clients, and suitable for a high-performance shared storage solution.
