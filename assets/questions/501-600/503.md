A company runs an infrastructure monitoring service. The company is building a new feature that will enable the service to monitor data in customer AWS accounts. The new feature will call AWS APIs in customer accounts to describe Amazon EC2 instances and read Amazon CloudWatch metrics. What should the company do to obtain access to customer accounts in the MOST secure way? 

A. Ensure that the customers create an IAM role in their account with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions and a trust policy to the company’s account. 

B. Create a serverless API that implements a token vending machine to provide temporary AWS credentials for a role with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions. 

C. Ensure that the customers create an IAM user in their account with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions. Encrypt and store customer access and secret keys in a secrets management system. 

D. Ensure that the customers create an Amazon Cognito user in their account to use an IAM role with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions. Encrypt and store the Amazon Cognito user and password in a secrets management system.

<b>A</b>

**A. Ensure that the customers create an IAM role in their account with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions and a trust policy to the company’s account.**

### Explanation:

- **IAM Role with Cross-Account Access:**
    - **Security Best Practices:** Option A is the most secure way to access customer accounts because it uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with cross-account access. By using IAM roles, customers do not need to share their credentials with the company. Instead, the customers create a role with the necessary permissions (read-only for EC2 and CloudWatch) and configure a trust policy that allows the company’s AWS account to assume this role.
    - **Temporary Security Credentials:** When the company’s account assumes this role, AWS provides temporary security credentials to perform the required actions. These credentials are short-lived and do not need to be stored or managed by the company, reducing the risk of exposure.
    - **Fine-Grained Access Control:** The company only has access to the specific AWS APIs (describe EC2 instances and read CloudWatch metrics) needed for the monitoring service, based on the permissions granted by the customer.

### Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:

- **B. Token Vending Machine with Temporary AWS Credentials:**
    - While a token vending machine can provide temporary credentials, this approach adds complexity and requires maintaining additional infrastructure. Furthermore, it is unnecessary when AWS IAM roles already provide a secure and managed way to issue temporary credentials.

- **C. IAM User with Static Credentials:**
    - This option is less secure because it involves creating an IAM user with static credentials (access key and secret key) in the customer’s account. Storing and managing these credentials, even in a secrets management system, poses a higher risk of exposure or misuse. Static credentials do not automatically expire and could be accidentally exposed.

- **D. Amazon Cognito User with IAM Role:**
    - Amazon Cognito is designed for identity management, often for end-user applications, and not for securely accessing AWS resources across accounts. Storing Cognito user credentials and using them to access an IAM role in a different account is not a recommended practice for cross-account access to AWS resources. This option introduces unnecessary complexity and is not aligned with typical AWS best practices for cross-account access.

By using **Option A**, the company leverages AWS's built-in, secure, and flexible mechanisms for cross-account access without needing to manage sensitive credentials directly, ensuring the **MOST secure** approach to accessing customer AWS accounts.
