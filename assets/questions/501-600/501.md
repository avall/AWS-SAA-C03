A company wants to ingest customer payment data into the company's data lake in Amazon S3. The company receives payment data every minute on average. The company wants to analyze the payment data in real time. Then the company wants to ingest the data into the data lake. Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational eficiency? 

A. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest data. Use AWS Lambda to analyze the data in real time. 

B. Use AWS Glue to ingest data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to analyze the data in real time.

C. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to ingest data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to analyze the data in real time. 

D. Use Amazon API Gateway to ingest data. Use AWS Lambda to analyze the data in real time.

<b>C</b>

**C. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to ingest data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to analyze the data in real time.**

### Explanation:

1. **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose:**
    - **Ingestion Efficiency:** Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that provides an easy way to load streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics services. It automatically scales to match the volume and throughput of data, making it ideal for continuous data ingestion.
    - **Operational Efficiency:** Kinesis Data Firehose requires minimal setup and management, reducing the operational overhead. It can directly ingest data into Amazon S3 (data lake) and also supports preprocessing and transformations of data before storage.

2. **Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics:**
    - **Real-Time Analysis:** Kinesis Data Analytics can process and analyze streaming data in real-time. It allows you to run SQL queries against the streaming data, detect anomalies, generate alerts, and derive actionable insights.
    - **Seamless Integration:** Kinesis Data Analytics integrates seamlessly with Kinesis Data Firehose, allowing you to analyze data in real time before it is ingested into Amazon S3.

### Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:

- **A. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and AWS Lambda:**
    - **Operational Complexity:** This option involves using Kinesis Data Streams for ingestion and AWS Lambda for real-time analysis. While this setup can work, it introduces more complexity in terms of configuration and management compared to Kinesis Data Firehose and Kinesis Data Analytics, which are more streamlined and integrated for such use cases.

- **B. AWS Glue and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics:**
    - **Mismatch in Purpose:** AWS Glue is primarily an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service and is not designed for real-time data ingestion or analysis. Using AWS Glue for ingesting data every minute is not the most efficient approach. Kinesis Data Firehose is more suitable for continuous ingestion and real-time processing.

- **D. Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda:**
    - **Higher Latency and Complexity:** While API Gateway can ingest data, it is not optimized for high-throughput streaming data ingestion that occurs every minute. This solution also requires managing additional components (API Gateway and Lambda), which increases operational overhead. Moreover, API Gateway is generally used for RESTful APIs, not for streaming data into a data lake.

Thus, **Option C** offers the most operational efficiency by using managed services that are specifically designed for real-time streaming data ingestion and analysis, minimizing the need for extensive configuration and management.
