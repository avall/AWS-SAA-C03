A company runs a website that uses a content management system (CMS) on Amazon EC2. The CMS runs on a single EC2 instance and uses an Amazon Aurora MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance for the data tier. Website images are stored on an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that is mounted inside the EC2 instance. Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to improve the performance and resilience of the website? (Choose two.) 

A. Move the website images into an Amazon S3 bucket that is mounted on every EC2 instance 

B. Share the website images by using an NFS share from the primary EC2 instance. Mount this share on the other EC2 instances. 

C. Move the website images onto an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system that is mounted on every EC2 instance. 

D. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the existing EC2 instance. Use the AMI to provision new instances behind an Application Load Balancer as part of an Auto Scaling group. Configure the Auto Scaling group to maintain a minimum of two instances. Configure an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator for the website 

E. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the existing EC2 instance. Use the AMI to provision new instances behind an Application Load Balancer as part of an Auto Scaling group. Configure the Auto Scaling group to maintain a minimum of two instances. Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the website.

The correct answer is:\
\
**C,E**

**C. Move the website images onto an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system that is mounted on every EC2 instance.**  

**E. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the existing EC2 instance. Use the AMI to provision new instances behind an Application Load Balancer as part of an Auto Scaling group. Configure the Auto Scaling group to maintain a minimum of two instances. Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the website.**

### Explanation:

1. **C. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System):**
    - **Performance Improvement:** Amazon EFS provides a scalable, shared file storage that can be accessed concurrently from multiple EC2 instances. Moving website images from an EBS volume (which is attached to a single EC2 instance) to EFS enables multiple instances to access the images simultaneously, improving scalability and potentially performance.
    - **Resilience:** EFS is designed to be highly available and durable, storing data redundantly across multiple Availability Zones. This provides resilience and ensures that the website can continue to operate even if a single instance or Availability Zone fails.

2. **E. Auto Scaling Group and CloudFront:**
    - **Performance Improvement:** By creating an AMI from the existing EC2 instance and using it to provision new instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) as part of an Auto Scaling group, the company can ensure that there are always at least two instances running. This setup improves performance by distributing traffic across multiple instances and helps handle increases in traffic automatically.
    - **Resilience:** The Auto Scaling group ensures high availability by automatically replacing failed instances and maintaining the desired number of instances. Additionally, Amazon CloudFront (a content delivery network) can cache website content at edge locations globally, reducing latency and further improving performance for end users. CloudFront also adds an extra layer of resilience by handling traffic spikes and providing DDoS protection.

### Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:

- **A. Amazon S3 bucket mounted on every EC2 instance:**  
  Amazon S3 does not support being mounted like a file system. While S3 is excellent for storing static content and serving it over HTTP(S), it is not intended for direct mounting on EC2 instances. Additionally, using S3 in this way does not inherently improve resilience of compute resources or the CMS application itself.

- **B. NFS share from the primary EC2 instance:**  
  This option involves creating a single point of failure. If the primary EC2 instance fails, the NFS share becomes unavailable, which negatively impacts resilience. This solution does not scale well and does not provide the benefits of a fully managed, scalable storage solution like EFS.

- **D. AWS Global Accelerator:**  
  While AWS Global Accelerator can improve performance by directing traffic to the optimal endpoint based on network latency and health, it is more suitable for globally distributed applications where low-latency global access is crucial. For this use case, CloudFront is a better fit because it caches content closer to users and improves website load times.
