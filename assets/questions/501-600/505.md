A company has Amazon EC2 instances that run nightly batch jobs to process data. The EC2 instances run in an Auto Scaling group that uses On-Demand billing. If a job fails on one instance, another instance will reprocess the job. The batch jobs run between 12:00 AM and 06:00 AM local time every day. Which solution will provide EC2 instances to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

A. Purchase a 1-year Savings Plan for Amazon EC2 that covers the instance family of the Auto Scaling group that the batch job uses. 

B. Purchase a 1-year Reserved Instance for the specific instance type and operating system of the instances in the Auto Scaling group that the batch job uses. 

C. Create a new launch template for the Auto Scaling group. Set the instances to Spot Instances. Set a policy to scale out based on CPU usage. 

D. Create a new launch template for the Auto Scaling group. Increase the instance size. Set a policy to scale out based on CPU usage.

The correct answer is:\

**The correct answer is:

**C. Create a new launch template for the Auto Scaling group. Set the instances to Spot Instances. Set a policy to scale out based on CPU usage.**

### Explanation:

- **Spot Instances:**
    - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Amazon EC2 Spot Instances allow you to take advantage of unused EC2 capacity at a significant discount compared to On-Demand pricing. They are typically 70-90% cheaper than On-Demand instances. Since the batch jobs run nightly and are not time-sensitive (as they can be reprocessed if a job fails), Spot Instances are ideal for this use case.
    - **Auto Scaling with Spot Instances:** By configuring the Auto Scaling group to use Spot Instances, the company can save costs while still meeting the requirements of running batch jobs. Additionally, setting a policy to scale based on CPU usage ensures that the Auto Scaling group dynamically adjusts the number of instances based on workload demand, further optimizing cost and performance.

### Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:

- **A. 1-Year Savings Plan:**
    - **Not Optimal for Intermittent Workloads:** A Savings Plan provides a lower price for a consistent amount of usage (e.g., all hours of the day for a certain period), which does not align well with a workload that only runs for 6 hours each night. While it could save costs compared to On-Demand instances, it is not as cost-effective as Spot Instances for a workload that does not require continuous operation.

- **B. 1-Year Reserved Instance:**
    - **Lack of Flexibility:** Reserved Instances are best for steady-state, predictable workloads. They do not provide flexibility for scaling up or down, as the company would still pay for the Reserved Instance whether it is used or not. This option is not as cost-effective for a batch job that runs only a few hours each night and has variable instance usage.

- **D. Increase Instance Size and Scale Out Based on CPU Usage:**
    - **Higher Cost and Overprovisioning:** Increasing the instance size would increase costs and could result in overprovisioning resources, especially if the workload does not consistently require the increased capacity. This approach does not specifically address cost savings and would likely be more expensive than optimizing with Spot Instances.

In conclusion, **Option C** provides the **most cost-effective** solution by leveraging the low cost of Spot Instances and dynamically scaling based on actual workload needs.
