A company wants to use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to run its on-premises application in a hybrid environment. The application currently runs on containers on premises.

The company needs a single container solution that can scale in an on-premises, hybrid, or cloud environment. The company must run new application containers in the AWS Cloud and must use a load balancer for HTTP traffic.

Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Set up an ECS cluster that uses the AWS Fargate launch type for the cloud application containers. Use an Amazon ECS Anywhere external launch type for the on-premises application containers. Most Voted

B. Set up an Application Load Balancer for cloud ECS services. Most Voted

C. Set up a Network Load Balancer for cloud ECS services.

D. Set up an ECS cluster that uses the AWS Fargate launch type. Use Fargate for the cloud application containers and the on-premises application containers.

E. Set up an ECS cluster that uses the Amazon EC2 launch type for the cloud application containers. Use Amazon ECS Anywhere with an AWS Fargate launch type for the on-premises application containers.

<b>A,B</b>

**A. Set up an ECS cluster that uses the AWS Fargate launch type for the cloud application containers. Use an Amazon ECS Anywhere external launch type for the on-premises application containers.**  
**B. Set up an Application Load Balancer for cloud ECS services.**

### Explanation:

1. **A. AWS Fargate for Cloud and ECS Anywhere for On-Premises:**
    - **AWS Fargate Launch Type:** Fargate is a serverless compute engine that allows you to run containers without managing the underlying infrastructure. This is ideal for the cloud portion of your hybrid environment, as it provides scalability and ease of management.
    - **Amazon ECS Anywhere:** ECS Anywhere allows you to extend ECS to run containers on your on-premises servers, enabling a hybrid environment where you can manage both cloud and on-premises containers through a single ECS control plane. By using ECS Anywhere with an external launch type, you can efficiently manage your on-premises application containers.

2. **B. Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
    - **HTTP Traffic Management:** An Application Load Balancer is well-suited for distributing HTTP/HTTPS traffic across multiple ECS tasks running in the cloud. ALB supports dynamic host port mapping, making it a good choice for containerized applications where you need to balance incoming web traffic across multiple containers.

### Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:

- **C. Network Load Balancer (NLB):**
    - While NLB is useful for handling TCP/UDP traffic and providing high performance for Layer 4 load balancing, it is not the best fit for handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic compared to an ALB, which is specifically designed for Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) traffic.

- **D. Fargate for Both Cloud and On-Premises:**
    - AWS Fargate is not supported on-premises; it is a cloud-only service. Therefore, this option is not feasible for a hybrid environment where the application also runs on-premises.

- **E. EC2 Launch Type and Fargate for On-Premises:**
    - ECS Anywhere supports running containers on on-premises servers but not with Fargate. Additionally, using the EC2 launch type in the cloud adds unnecessary infrastructure management overhead compared to using Fargate, which is serverless and more operationally efficient.

In conclusion, **Options A and B** provide a comprehensive solution that allows the company to run and manage their application in both on-premises and cloud environments while efficiently handling HTTP traffic using an Application Load Balancer.
