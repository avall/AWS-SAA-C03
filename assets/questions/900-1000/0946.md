A company runs its production workload on an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster that includes six Aurora Replicas. The company wants near-real-time reporting queries from one of its departments to be automatically distributed across three of the Aurora Replicas. Those three replicas have a different compute and memory specification from the rest of the DB cluster.

Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Create and use a custom endpoint for the workload

B. Create a three-node cluster clone and use the reader endpoint

C. Use any of the instance endpoints for the selected three nodes

D. Use the reader endpoint to automatically distribute the read-only workload
