A media company has a multi-account AWS environment in the us-east-1 Region. The company has an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic in a production account that publishes performance metrics. The company has an AWS Lambda function in an administrator account to process and analyze log data.

The Lambda function that is in the administrator account must be invoked by messages from the SNS topic that is in the production account when significant metrics are reported.

Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Create an IAM resource policy for the Lambda function that allows Amazon SNS to invoke the function.

B. Implement an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in the administrator account to buffer messages from the SNS topic that is in the production account. Configure the SQS queue to invoke the Lambda function.

C. Create an IAM policy for the SNS topic that allows the Lambda function to subscribe to the topic.

D. Use an Amazon EventBridge rule in the production account to capture the SNS topic notifications. Configure the EventBridge rule to forward notifications to the Lambda function that is in the administrator account.

E. Store performance metrics in an Amazon S3 bucket in the production account. Use Amazon Athena to analyze the metrics from the administrator account.
