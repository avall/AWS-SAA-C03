A company uses Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to run its applications in the us-east-1 Region. The company also uses machine learning (ML) models to forecast annual revenue based on near real-time reports. The reports are generated by using the same RDS for PostgreSQL database. The database performance slows during business hours. The company needs to improve database performance.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Create a cross-Region read replica. Configure the reports to be generated from the read replica.

B. Activate Multi-AZ DB instance deployment for RDS for PostgreSQL. Configure the reports to be generated from the standby database.

C. Use AWS Data Migration Service (AWS DMS) to logically replicate data to a new database. Configure the reports to be generated from the new database.

D. Create a read replica in us-east-1. Configure the reports to be generated from the read replica.
