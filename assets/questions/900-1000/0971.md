A company that is in the ap-northeast-1 Region has a fleet of thousands of AWS Outposts servers. The company has deployed the servers at remote locations around the world. All the servers regularly download new software versions that consist of 100 files. There is significant latency before all servers run the new software versions.

The company must reduce the deployment latency for new software versions.

Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?

B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket in ap-northeast-1. Create a second S3 bucket in the us-east-1 Region. Configure replication between the buckets. Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution that uses ap-northeast-1 as the primary origin and us-east-1 as the secondary origin. Download the software by using signed URLs.
