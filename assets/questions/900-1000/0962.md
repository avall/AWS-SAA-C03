A company uses an Amazon DynamoDB table to store data that the company receives from devices. The DynamoDB table supports a customer-facing website to display recent activity on customer devices. The company configured the table with provisioned throughput for writes and reads.

The company wants to calculate performance metrics for customer device data on a daily basis. The solution must have minimal effect on the table's provisioned read and write capacity.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use an Amazon Athena SQL query with the Amazon Athena DynamoDB connector to calculate performance metrics on a recurring schedule.

B. Use an AWS Glue job with the AWS Glue DynamoDB export connector to calculate performance metrics on a recurring schedule.

C. Use an Amazon Redshift COPY command to calculate performance metrics on a recurring schedule.

D. Use an Amazon EMR job with an Apache Hive external table to calculate performance metrics on a recurring schedule.
