A company wants to migrate an application to AWS. The company wants to increase the application's current availability. The company wants to use AWS WAF in the application's architecture.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an Auto Scaling group that contains multiple Amazon EC2 instances that host the application across two Availability Zones. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and set the Auto Scaling group as the target. Connect a WAF to the ALB.

B. Create a cluster placement group that contains multiple Amazon EC2 instances that hosts the application. Configure an Application Load Balancer and set the EC2 instances as the targets. Connect a WAF to the placement group.

C. Create two Amazon EC2 instances that host the application across two Availability Zones. Configure the EC2 instances as the targets of an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Connect a WAF to the ALB.

D. Create an Auto Scaling group that contains multiple Amazon EC2 instances that host the application across two Availability Zones. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and set the Auto Scaling group as the target. Connect a WAF to the Auto Scaling group.

<b>A</b>

**A. Create an Auto Scaling group that contains multiple Amazon EC2 instances that host the application across two Availability Zones. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and set the Auto Scaling group as the target. Connect a WAF to the ALB.**

### Explanation:

1. **High Availability with Auto Scaling and Multi-AZ Deployment:**
    - **Auto Scaling Group:** An Auto Scaling group allows you to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand. This ensures that the application can handle varying levels of traffic while maintaining performance. If the demand increases, more instances are automatically launched; if it decreases, instances are terminated.
    - **Multiple Availability Zones (Multi-AZ):** Deploying EC2 instances across two Availability Zones (AZs) ensures high availability. If one AZ experiences a failure, the instances in the other AZ can continue to serve the application, minimizing downtime.

2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
    - **Load Distribution:** The ALB distributes incoming traffic across the EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group. This not only improves application availability but also enhances performance by ensuring that no single instance is overwhelmed with too much traffic.
    - **Integration with WAF:** AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is used to protect your web applications from common web exploits and bots that can affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. By attaching WAF to the ALB, you ensure that all incoming traffic is filtered before reaching your application, providing an additional layer of security.

3. **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall):**
    - **Security Enhancement:** AWS WAF helps protect your application by allowing you to create custom rules to block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). By connecting WAF to the ALB, all traffic is inspected and filtered according to your defined rules, reducing the risk of security breaches.

### Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:

- **B. Cluster Placement Group:**
    - **Single Availability Zone:** A cluster placement group is designed for low-latency, high-throughput workloads by placing instances close together in a single AZ. However, it does not provide the high availability that comes from spreading instances across multiple AZs, making it less suitable for this scenario.

- **C. Two EC2 Instances Across Two AZs:**
    - **No Auto Scaling:** While this option does provide availability across two AZs, it lacks the flexibility and automatic scaling provided by an Auto Scaling group. Without Auto Scaling, the application might struggle to handle traffic spikes, leading to performance issues.

- **D. WAF Attached to Auto Scaling Group:**
    - **Incorrect Attachment:** WAF cannot be directly attached to an Auto Scaling group. WAF is designed to protect web applications by being attached to an ALB, CloudFront distribution, or API Gateway. Therefore, this option is not technically feasible.

### Summary:

**Option A** offers a well-architected solution that improves the application's availability by using an Auto Scaling group spread across multiple Availability Zones. The ALB provides load balancing, and the integration with AWS WAF adds a layer of security, making this the most comprehensive and effective solution for the company's requirements.
