A company is migrating its workloads to AWS. The company has sensitive and critical data in on-premises relational databases that run on SQL Server instances.

The company wants to use the AWS Cloud to increase security and reduce operational overhead for the databases.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Migrate the databases to Amazon EC2 instances. Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key for encryption.

B. Migrate the databases to a Multi-AZ Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance. Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key for encryption.

C. Migrate the data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon Macie to ensure data security.

D. Migrate the databases to an Amazon DynamoDB table. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to ensure data security.

The correct answer is:

<b>B</b>

Migrate the databases to a Multi-AZ Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance. Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key for encryption.**
  
  ### Explanation:
  
  1. **Amazon RDS for SQL Server:**
     - **Managed Service:** Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for SQL Server is a managed service that reduces operational overhead by automating tasks like backups, patch management, and scaling. This allows the company to focus on its applications rather than database management.
     - **Multi-AZ Deployment:** A Multi-AZ RDS deployment provides high availability and durability by automatically replicating data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone. This setup ensures that the database remains available even in the event of an AZ failure, which is critical for sensitive and critical data.
  
  2. **AWS KMS Managed Key:**
     - **Enhanced Security:** Using AWS KMS (Key Management Service) for encryption provides a robust, centralized way to manage and control encryption keys. With KMS, the company can enforce strict access controls and audit key usage, ensuring that the sensitive data is protected both at rest and in transit.
  
  ### Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:
  
  - **A. Migrate the Databases to Amazon EC2 Instances:**
     - **Higher Operational Overhead:** Running SQL Server on EC2 would require the company to manage everything from the operating system to backups, patching, and scaling, which increases operational overhead compared to a managed service like RDS. This option does not provide the same level of automation and ease of use as RDS.
  
  - **C. Migrate the Data to an Amazon S3 Bucket:**
     - **Not Suitable for Relational Databases:** S3 is a storage service designed for object storage, not for running relational databases. Migrating relational databases to S3 would not meet the company's needs for a managed database service with high availability and performance.
  
  - **D. Migrate the Databases to an Amazon DynamoDB Table:**
     - **Incompatible Database Type:** DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service, which is fundamentally different from SQL Server, a relational database. Migrating a SQL Server database to DynamoDB would require significant changes to the data model and application code, and would not be a straightforward migration. Additionally, DynamoDB does not natively support SQL queries.
  
  In summary, **Option B** provides a managed, highly available, and secure solution for running SQL Server databases in AWS, meeting the company's requirements to increase security and reduce operational overhead.
