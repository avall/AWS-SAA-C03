A company recently performed a lift and shift migration of its on-premises Oracle database workload to run on an Amazon EC2 memory optimized Linux instance. The EC2 Linux instance uses a 1 TB Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume with 64,000 IOPS.

The database storage performance after the migration is slower than the performance of the on-premises database.

Which solution will improve storage performance?

A. Add more Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volumes. Use OS commands to create a Logical Volume Management (LVM) stripe.

B. Increase the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume to more than 64,000 IOPS.

C. Increase the size of the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume to 2 TB.

D. Change the EC2 Linux instance to a storage optimized instance type. Do not change the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume.
