A company hosts a monolithic web application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Application users have recently reported poor performance at specific times. Analysis of Amazon CloudWatch metrics shows that CPU utilization is 100% during the periods of poor performance.

The company wants to resolve this performance issue and improve application availability.

Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)

A. Use AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale vertically.

B. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the web server. Reference the AMI in a new launch template.

C. Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale vertically.

D. Use AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale horizontally.

E. Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale horizontally.

The correct answer is:\

## Explanation
To address the performance issues of the monolithic web application and improve its availability, the company needs to consider both vertical scaling (increasing the instance size) and horizontal scaling (adding more instances to share the load). Here's how the options stack up:

### **Option A: Use AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale vertically.**
- **Vertical Scaling**: This involves moving to a larger EC2 instance with more CPU, memory, etc. AWS Compute Optimizer can analyze the current instance's performance and suggest a more appropriate instance type that can handle the load better. However, while this may temporarily solve the issue, it doesn't address potential future scaling needs or redundancy.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Vertical scaling might be cost-effective in the short term but is limited by the largest available instance size and doesn’t inherently improve availability.

### **Option B: Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the web server. Reference the AMI in a new launch template.**
- **AMI Creation**: Creating an AMI from the current instance allows you to easily replicate the server configuration. This is a necessary step for setting up an Auto Scaling group or deploying more instances, which would be part of horizontal scaling.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: This is a preparatory step rather than a solution by itself. It’s not directly linked to cost savings but is necessary for implementing horizontal scaling.

### **Option C: Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale vertically.**
- **Vertical Scaling**: Vertical scaling within an Auto Scaling group is not a typical or efficient use case. Auto Scaling is designed for horizontal scaling, i.e., adding/removing instances. This option is somewhat contradictory because it mixes concepts that don't align well (Auto Scaling with vertical scaling).
- **Cost-effectiveness**: This is not a viable or cost-effective approach for solving the problem.

### **Option D: Use AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale horizontally.**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: This is not the correct interpretation of AWS Compute Optimizer’s functionality, as it is more focused on vertical scaling recommendations. Horizontal scaling requires setting up an Auto Scaling group, not just choosing an instance type.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: This option is misleading as it doesn’t directly apply.

### **Option E: Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale horizontally.**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: This is the best approach for both improving performance and availability. By setting up an Auto Scaling group, you can automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to demand, distributing traffic using an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
- **Cost-effectiveness**: This option is very cost-effective for handling varying loads and ensuring high availability by distributing traffic across multiple instances.

### **Best Combination of Steps:**
- **E. Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale horizontally.**
- **B. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the web server. Reference the AMI in a new launch template.**

**Explanation:**
- **E** is critical for horizontal scaling, which improves both performance and availability by automatically adding or removing instances based on demand.
- **B** is necessary for creating a consistent and easily replicable setup across multiple instances in the Auto Scaling group.

By combining these steps, the company can ensure that its application is both scalable and highly available, all while keeping costs under control.



# Other explanations
## Explanation
The key issue is that the EC2 instance hosting the monolithic web app is experiencing 100% CPU utilization during periods of poor performance. To resolve this, the application needs to be able to scale out horizontally by adding more EC2 instances to handle the load, rather than scaling up vertically with a larger instance size.

Creating an AMI allows you to save the current state of the web server, including the OS, application code, and configurations. Referencing this AMI in a launch template enables Auto Scaling to spin up additional EC2 instances that are pre-configured like the original instance.

An Auto Scaling group uses the launch template to automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on scaling policies and metrics like CPU utilization. This allows the application to scale out during high load periods by adding instances, and scale in when load decreases to optimize costs.

An Application Load Balancer distributes incoming application traffic across the multiple EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group. It performs health checks and only routes requests to healthy instances.

So in summary, creating an AMI, launch template, Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer allows the monolithic application to automatically scale horizontally in a cost-effective manner based on traffic and load. This improves performance by eliminating CPU bottlenecks and increases availability by running the application on multiple instances.

The other options are not ideal because:

A and D suggest using AWS Compute Optimizer to get vertical or horizontal scaling recommendations, but the question states scaling should be done cost-effectively, and Compute Optimizer recommendations can suggest larger, more costly instance types. Manual effort is also required to implement the recommendations.\

C suggests using an Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer to scale vertically, but vertical scaling would not resolve the CPU bottleneck as cost-effectively as horizontal scaling by adding more instances.
Therefore, B and E are the correct combination of steps to meet the requirements most cost-effectively.
